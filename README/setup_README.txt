This script automatically creates/updates a Projects Episode based on an Adobe Premiere generated XML. This includes the Episode, Sequences and Shots.

SETUP:
	> In Premiere
		>> Name the timeline according to the episode
		>> Name the shots correctly, include transitions with the shots
		>> Name the sequences correctly
		>> Export XML
	> In Shotgun
		>> Set Client Name if there is one (Located in project info) 
			**THIS VARIABLE WILL MAKE THE SCRIPTS LOOK FOR THE PROJECT FOLDER INSIDE THE CLIENTS FOLDER ON THE SHARE DRIVE**
		>> Set Share Drive Path (Located in project info)
		>> Set Setup XML (Located in project info)

TYPICAL USAGE: 
	> Define 'Setup XML' in Project Info
	> Click 'Project Setup' button (Located under 'Project Actions' inside the project)

Required Files: 
	> EPISODE_NAME.xml - the xml generated by premiere that must be located in \05_PROD\DATA\XML
	> setuplog.log - logs the scripts process and any errors encountered. Look here if the script does not run correctly
	> episodename_editdata.xml - episode specific xml generated from the premiere xml
	> SetupAMIScript.py - script triggered in shotgun that reads an XML, generates a simplified version and then creates/updates information in Shotgun

Requirements: 
	> Windows Operating System
	> All project paths set correctly
	> Premiere generated XML file in correct location

TROUBLESHOOTING:
	> Check the setuplog.log file for any errors in SetupAMIScript.py
	> Confirm EPISODE_NAME.xml is in the correct location
	> Confirm episodename_editdata.xml has been generated
	> Confirm Windows Registry has been set correctly
	> Confirm Shotgun Script Name, Server and Key is accurate in SetupAMIScript.py
